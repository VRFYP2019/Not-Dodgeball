# Project Information
This document will contain any and all information pertaining to the unity VR project, Not Dodgeball(temp name).

**Project Description**

The project aims to make exercising fun with VR and Sensors. Body movements will be sensed with attached sensors (eg. vive tracker) and converted as input for the VR system. Users play the game by exercising. Appropriate virtual (in-game) rewards will be designed to motivate the players for winning.

# Not Dodgeball VR the game 2020

**Core mechanics:**
- Two players (A and B).
- Goal for A is behind B and vice versa.
- Player's Goal is attached to the player and will move as th player moves, following behind at a set distance.
- Game starts with each player owning 1 ball
- Players try to score into their respective goals.
- Points awarded for goals.
- Ball can bounce off every surface with physics matching ball material, and wall material.
- Ball belongs to player who last touched it, and players can own goal.
- Every ball that is scored causes 2 balls to spawn (TBC).
- The maximum number of balls allowed in the game is decided by the game host.
- The duration of a match, as well as the number of matches to count as a game, are also decided by the host.
- In case of the ball coming to a stop, destroy and spawn back in players hand.
- If a player's hand remains stationary, the tool will become transparent and balls will not collide with it.

**Design Sketches:**


**Fitness involvement:**
- Requires a lot of movement. Kicking(TBC) and smacking balls are allowed, hence it can be a full body workout

**Projected behavioural impact:**
- It is a game that would be a logistical nightmare to implement in real life due to the number of balls to keep track of, so it is safe to assume there is no viable substitute for this game.
- With gimmicks such as daily rewards and in-game purchases implemented right, we can keep a significant number of players hooked on to the game and play it everyday, allowing them to get excerise through play.

**Notes:**

- It would be desirable to have a single player mode. We can use pure random rotation and flailing about to create a simple bot, but we should eventually turn to AI.
- Could require a tracker on each foot for kicking and/or dodging
- This is also hard to make fun/work as a PC game so it&#39;s very good for VR
- Should we curve the edges of the walls where they intersect to make the bouncing less predictable humanly? Again, more like air hockey style.

- This sem just make a simple playable game first, next sem then add the crazy shit
- Also add marketing?
- Need some learning value? Demonstration of new hardware? Pure game is ok but no A :( e.g. learn properties of diff materials (rubber ball vs styrofoam ball vs leather ball etc but by developing our own physics engine provided we can prove that existing one is not good enough)
- Possibly also change the shape and size of the ball
- Let players upload their own materials? Or at least customize existing ones
- Customize walls and tools too
- Do it for the KIDZ
- Individual contributions eg one do sensing hardware or smth
- Use machine learning to build our AI?
